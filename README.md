# Usage

* **MyBurger!** is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


* Each burger in the waiting area also has an EAT! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not unless it is deleted .
